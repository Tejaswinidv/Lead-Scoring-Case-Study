# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study 
## Project Overview

This case study focuses on analyzing a leads dataset containing approximately 9,000 data points to predict lead conversion outcomes. The target variable, ‘Converted,’ signifies whether a lead was successfully converted (1) or not (0).

The primary goal is to develop a logistic regression model that assigns a lead score (ranging from 0 to 100) to help prioritize leads based on their likelihood of conversion. Higher scores indicate "hot" leads with strong conversion potential, whereas lower scores represent "cold" leads.

Additionally, the project aims to address specific business challenges outlined separately. The model and recommendations should be adaptable to evolving business needs.

The deliverables include:

* A well-documented logistic regression model.
* Solutions to key business challenges.
* A concise presentation summarizing key findings and actionable insights.
* A detailed report outlining the methodology, results, and key learnings.
  
This analysis helps the company optimize its lead conversion process by identifying and prioritizing high-potential leads.
